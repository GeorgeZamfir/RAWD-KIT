                "I don't understand how the AODA applies to my organization". "My team doesn't know WCAG". "How do I know when I'm compliant?". "What about reporting deadlines?".  There's definitely a lot of confusion out there and frankly quite a few misunderstandings.
            </p>
            <p>
                I can help you make sense of the requirements and separate the signal from the noise. Whether you represent a small or large, private or public organization the WCAG 2 requirements are the same for everyone, the only difference is in implementation and reporting deadlines.

                My expertise lies with the Information & Communications Standard â€” or simply put, the web accessibility component. Get in contact with me for a free consultation.

                I believe that a simple "Yes or No" WCAG checklist is not very helpful, at best it tells you what you already knew; nor is pointing fingers at people or teams, almost always people have the best intentions. In my experience the best audits hit 2 clear targets: indicating accessibility violations AND proposing actionable solutions. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I conduct audits and evaluations that present a clear gap analysis AND actionable solutions. My goal is for your project stakeholders to understand where the project is and what needs to be done exactly.

                Traditional knowledge says that smaller devices are harder to use, especially for people with disabilities. I actually believe that the explosion of mobile has been a fantastic step forward for accessibility. Don't think about a mobile device as just a desktop computer with smaller screen, think about all the features you never had on a desktop PC: touch gestures, accelerometers, gyroscope sensors, geolocation, etc.

                The devices we used to access the web 5 years ago (the first iPhone was released in 2007) are as different as the ones we will use 5 years from now. Building web products for specific browsers or devices is just no feasible anymore. My approach is to build with web standards that countless experts have developed. While not even this may be future-proof it is at least future friendly.

                Building accessible web properties is the easy part. The hard part is building accessible web properties on a legacy framework or older Content Management Systems (CMS) or with a team that does not have accessibility experience.
            </p>                     
            <p>
                The technical accessibility challenges are usually tied to the technology stack being employed - an old CMS, legacy systems, outdated code, etc. I am fortunate that diverse projects presented these challenges to me early on and in turn I can help you with these challenges and we don't have to reinvent the wheel. I can deliver technical solutions that are suited to your environment and specific to your technology stack.
